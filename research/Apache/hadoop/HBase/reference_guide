HBase isn't suitable for every problem.

First, make sure you have enough data. If you have hundreds of millions or billions of rows, then HBase is a good candidate. If you only have a few thousand/million rows, then using a traditional RDBMS might be a better choice due to the fact that all of your data might wind up on a single node...

首先，要有足够的数据。如果你有上亿或十亿行数据，hbase是个很好的候选。如果你只有几百万行数据，用传统REDMS是个好的选择，因为所有数据可以存在一个两个节点。

Second, make sure you can live without all the extra features that an RDBMS provides (e.g., typed columns, secondary indexes, transactions, advanced query languages, etc.) 

其次，确保你可以不依赖RDBMS提供的feature，（如可类型化的列，...，高级查询等）

Third, make sure you have enough hardware. Even HDFS doesn't do well with anything less than 5 DataNodes (due to things such as HDFS block replication which has a default of 3), plus a NameNode. 

第三，确保你有足够的硬件。即便HDFS在少于5个节点的情况下也不能工作的很好，加上一个namenode。
