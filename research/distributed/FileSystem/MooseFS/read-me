独立磁盘/分区作为存储？

It is important to dedicate file systems used by MooseFS chunks exclusively to it - this is necessary to manage the free space properly. 
MooseFS does not take into account that a free space accessible to it could be taken by other data. **
If it's not possible to create a separate disk partition, filesystems in files can be used.
