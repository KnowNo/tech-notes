几个DFS
ceph
hdfs
kfs(kosmosfs)
nfs
还有fastdfs，淘宝的tfs等
GFS的缺点主要是大批量比较好，我们的SCD可能大量小文件

还有
FUSE 
上述文件系统的fuse可能有另外组件，或者第三方人员开发
不是所有DFS都有FUSE支持。 
ceph可能最先进，但也可能稳定性上有问题	

如果一些DFS非常好，但缺乏FUSE支持，如果支持并不困难，也可以考虑为它写FUSE插件。




/**
The topology of distributed SF1 service:
(1) A Mirror is constituted of several SF1 Nodes, it provides full search data and functionality.

(2) Mirrors are replicated, Nodes(Workers) between mirrors should be one-to-one correspondence,
    i.e., "/Mirror1/Node1" and "/Mirror1/Node1" should carry the same search data.
    So that, if "/Mirror1/Node2" broken down, Masters in Mirror1 will know that it can switch to
    worker on "/Mirror2/Node2."

(3) Each node is a SF1 process that can be identified by mirrorId and nodeId (Ids are 1, 2, 3...),
    every node can work as Master or Worker (configurable).

(4) Every Master in all mirriors provides full search functionality in the same manner, they are exposed
    to higher-level applications as replicated SF1 servers.

Using ZooKeeper for distributed coordination, the associated data structure is defined as below:
/

SF1Root
|--- Topology                #
     |--- Mirror1
          |--- Node1
               |--- Master
               |--- Worker
          |--- Node2
               |--- Worker
     |--- Mirror2
          |--- Node1
               |--- Master
               |--- Worker
          |--- Node2
               |--- Master
               |--- Worker
|--- Service                 # SF1 Servers
     |--- Server00000000     # ---->  "/Topology/Mirror1/Node1/Master"
     |--- Server00000001
     |--- Server00000002
